In this project, we focused on analyzing different types of baseball pitches and, using differential equations—Euler's method and the Runge-Kutta method—aimed to model their motion dynamics. The simulations can serve as a training tool for improving pitching techniques, analyzing game tactics, and predicting ball behavior under various conditions.
