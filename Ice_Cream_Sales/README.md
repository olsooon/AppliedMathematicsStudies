In this project, we are focused on analyzing ice cream sales data using time series analysis methods. Specifically, we will examine long-term trends and seasonal sales patterns over the past 48 years. The results of the analysis will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the variability in ice cream sales over an extended period, as well as the potential use of the model for predictive purposes.
